# Zelkova - Machine Learning Toolkit

Zelkova is a toolkit aimed towards simple and easy deployment of ML models. 
 
In essence, it offers a wide selection of readily available architectures, ranging from the most generic
and popular ones, to the latest bleeding-edge. In addition to optimizers and evaluation metrics, 
custom logic blocks can also be created by the user or tune existing ones. 

Built on top of wgpu-rs, it relies on shader generation for the heavy lifting.

Currently very work-in-progress; refer to the checklist below.

Checklist: 
- [ ] functional math framework with wgpu (around August, overdue albeit 99% close to completion)
- [ ] model implementations (around Halloween)
- [ ] actually usable (uhh idk)
- [ ] soon
