# zelkova

`zelkova` is a toolkit aimed towards simple and easy deployment of ML models. Built on top of [wgpu](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu), 
it relies on shader generation focused on computing. 

## Overview

As it strives to be fit for almost every machine learning task, it offers a wide selection of readily available architectures, 
ranging from the most generic and popular ones, to the latest bleeding-edge. In addition to optimizers and evaluation metrics, 
custom logic blocks can also be created by the user or tune existing ones. 

Currently very work-in-progress; refer to the checklist below.

## Checklist: 
- [ ] functional math framework with wgpu (overdue, 99% done)
- [ ] model implementations (around Halloween)
- [ ] actually usable (uhh idk)
- [ ] soon
