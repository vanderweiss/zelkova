# zelkova

`zelkova` is a linear algebra library fulfilling the purpose of setting a reliable framework for array-like containers via GPUs. 

## Overview

Striving to fit almost any task and preparing the stage for libraries to come based off it, it aims to adapt to any context and manage resource usage to overcome limitations.

Currently very work-in-progress; refer to the checklist below.

## Checklist: 
- [ ] Functional math framework with OpenCL.
- [ ] Backend specific implementations (WebGPU, CUDA, OpenGL, Vulkan)
- [ ] Workload distribution and scheduling for hardware constraints.
- [ ] Specific optimizations for ML, rendering, etc.

**WARNING** Undergoing radical changes regarding the project's aim as of 2024. This is the currently maintained branch.
